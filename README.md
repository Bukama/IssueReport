# IssueReport

Generation reports with data from the Pioneers IssueExtension

This library will take a list of issue and check the executed tests if and how well they are covered. At the end it will
publish a report.

Status: early development 🏗💻

Thoughts:

* Several input formats for issue list
* Several output formats (XML, HTML), starting with XML as base for further tools (e.g. Jenkins-Pluings or XSLT

To be documented:
CSV files are read using the [OpenCSV reader](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/).
